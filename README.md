- National Instruments DAQ device (tested with Dev1)
- Analog output channels: ao0, ao1, ao2, ao3
- Digital output channels: port0/line8-31
- Analog input channels: ai19, ai20, ai21

### Software
- Python 3.8+
- Windows/Linux compatible
- NI-DAQmx drivers installed

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd MagFieldEmulator
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install NI-DAQmx drivers**
   - Download and install NI-DAQmx from National Instruments website
   - Ensure your DAQ device is properly connected and recognized

4. **Prepare data directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir data
   mkdir logs
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Start the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Select input data file**
   - The system will display available CSV files in the `data/` directory
   - Enter the file number to select your magnetic field data

3. **Interactive commands**
   Once running, you can use these commands:
   - `pause` - Pause the output
   - `resume` - Resume the output
   - `set interval <seconds>` - Change output interval (e.g., `set interval 30`)
   - `status` - Show current system status
   - `jump <row>` - Jump to specific data row
   - `save config` - Save current configuration
   - `stop` - Stop the system safely
   - `help` - Show all available commands

### Data Format

The system supports CSV files with magnetic field data in the following format:

```
YYYY MM DD HH Bx By Bz
2024 01 15 12 25000.5 -15000.2 45000.8
2024 01 15 12 25001.1 -15001.3 45001.2
...
```

Where:
- First 4 columns: Year, Month, Day, Hour (timestamp)
- Bx, By, Bz: Magnetic field components in nanotesla (nT)

### Configuration

The system uses `config.json` for configuration:

```json
{
  "csv_input": "None",
  "csv_folder": "data",
  "csv_log_folder": "log",
  "device_name": "Dev1",
  "nt_to_volt": 1e-05,
  "interval": 60.0,
  "log_flush_interval": 10
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `device_name`: DAQ device identifier
- `nt_to_volt`: Conversion factor from nanotesla to volts
- `interval`: Output interval in seconds
- `log_flush_interval`: Number of records before flushing log to disk

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **`main.py`**: Main application controller and command handling
- **`daq_controller.py`**: DAQ hardware interface and voltage output
- **`data_loader.py`**: CSV data loading and parsing
- **`app_config.py`**: Configuration management
- **`app_state.py`**: Thread-safe application state management
- **`log_manager.py`**: Logging system with automatic file management
- **`command_interface.py`**: Interactive command line interface

### Data Flow

1. CSV data is loaded and parsed by `DataLoader`
2. Magnetic field values are converted to voltages with gain/offset correction
3. Voltages are output through DAQ analog channels
4. Analog inputs are read for feedback/monitoring
5. All operations are logged with timestamps

### Safety Features

- **Voltage Limiting**: Automatic Â±10V output limiting
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Safe cleanup on exit signals
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- **Thread Safety**: Protected shared state with locks

## Calibration

The system includes automatic voltage offset correction:

```python
# Voltage calculation with calibration
vx = Bx * nt_to_volt * voltage_gain[0] + voltage_offset[0]
vy = By * nt_to_volt * voltage_gain[1] + voltage_offset[1]
vz = Bz * nt_to_volt * voltage_gain[2] + voltage_offset[2]
```

Calibration data is defined in `testing_data.py` with various field combinations for system characterization.

## Logging

The system automatically generates detailed CSV logs in the `log/` directory:

**Log Format:**
- `index`: Data row index
- `utc_time`: UTC timestamp
- `local_time`: Local timestamp
- `bx_nt`, `by_nt`, `bz_nt`: Magnetic field inputs (nT)
- `vx`, `vy`, `vz`: Output voltages (V)
- `analog_x`, `analog_y`, `analog_z`: Measured analog inputs
- `success`: Operation success flag

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **DAQ Device Not Found**
   - Verify device connection and NI-DAQmx installation
   - Check device name in configuration matches actual device

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Run as administrator if accessing hardware
   - Ensure DAQ device is not in use by other applications

3. **Data Loading Errors**
   - Verify CSV format matches expected structure
   - Check file encoding (UTF-8 recommended)

4. **Voltage Output Issues**
   - Verify channel mapping in configuration
   - Check voltage limits and gain settings
